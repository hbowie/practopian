<p>Hierarchy is a <a href="../core/values.html">Core Value</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We recognize the value of hierarchies in enabling both scale and complexity by repeatedly organizing smaller units into larger ones &ndash; atoms into molecules, cells into organisms, individuals into societies &ndash; and we recognize the need within any hierarchy to balance liberty and governance, as well as rigidity and flexibility.</p>
