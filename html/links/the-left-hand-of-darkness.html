<p>Just finished reading Ursula K. Le Guin&rsquo;s science fiction masterpiece, <em>The Left Hand of Darkness</em>. Or perhaps I should say rereading it, since I feel sure I must have enjoyed it once before, perhaps thirty or forty years ago, closer to when it was originally written, in 1969.</p>
<p>For those of you not familiar with it, this is a book:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>about an envoy from a foreign land, and a mad king;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>about power-hungry regents and political schemers;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>about the meaning of patriotism and the making of a traitor;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>about bravery and endurance;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>about taking in strangers and showing them kindness;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>about borders and border-crossings;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>about recognizing our common humanity, irrespective of gender or place of origin or kinship bond;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>about choosing progress for our fellow humans over personal gain or safety;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>about darkness and light;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>about forging a bond with all of humanity through the intimate knowing of one other human who is irredeemably different from ourselves;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>about waiting for a chance and then taking it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, it is the perfect book for our times.</p>
<p>I urge you to buy a copy today. If you&rsquo;re not familiar with it, read it. And then pass it on to someone else, perhaps someone unsure of the wisdom of welcoming strangers.</p>
<p>When logic and reason fail, perhaps stories like this can awaken new possibilities.</p>
