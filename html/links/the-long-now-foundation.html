<p>&ldquo;Civilization is revving itself into a pathologically short attention span. The trend might be coming from the acceleration of technology, the short-horizon perspective of market-driven economics, the next-election perspective of democracies, or the distractions of personal multi-tasking. All are on the increase. Some sort of balancing corrective to the short-sightedness is needed-some mechanism or myth which encourages the long view and the taking of long-term responsibility, where &lsquo;long-term&rsquo; is measured at least in centuries. Long Now proposes both a mechanism and a myth.&rdquo;</p>
