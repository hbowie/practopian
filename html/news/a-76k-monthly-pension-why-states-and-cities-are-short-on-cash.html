<blockquote>
<p>A public university president in Oregon gives new meaning to the idea of a pensioner.</p>
<p>Joseph Robertson, an eye surgeon who retired as head of the Oregon Health &amp; Science University last fall, receives the stateâ€™s largest government pension.</p>
<p>It is $76,111.</p>
<p>Per month.</p>
<p>That is considerably more than the average Oregon family earns in a year.</p>
<p>Oregon &ndash; like many other states and cities, including New Jersey, Kentucky and Connecticut &ndash; is caught in a fiscal squeeze of its own making. Its economy is growing, but the cost of its state-run pension system is growing faster. More government workers are retiring, including more than 2,000, like Dr. Robertson, who get pensions exceeding $100,000 a year.</p>
