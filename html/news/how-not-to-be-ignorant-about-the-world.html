<p>The mission of Gapminder Foundation is to fight devastating ignorance with a fact-based worldview that everyone can understand. We started the Ignorance Project to investigate what the public know and donâ€™t know about basic global patterns and macro-trends. We use surveys to ask representative groups of people simple questions about key-aspects of global development.</p>
