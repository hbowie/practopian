<p>Here you&rsquo;ll find a one-page summary of who we are and what we&rsquo;re about.</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>It has seemed to me for some time that there is a space &ndash; perhaps even a need &ndash; for some new institution to emerge in the world.</p>
<p>Our modern human landscape offers us an unprecedented degree of freedom, and fosters an almost unimaginable degree of diversity.</p>
<p>But this ever-expanding palette of options invites the question: is there a broad set of cultural elements that we can agree to share, in order to promote constructive discourse about how we humans wish our society to evolve?</p>
<p>Traditional religions offer one set of answers to this question.</p>
<p>But can we construct another option? A new institution that provides another sort of answer?</p>
<p><em>The Practopians</em> is an experiment attempting to answer this very question.</p>
<h3>Mission</h3>
<p>The Practical Utopian seeks to identify and promote beliefs, principles, values and actions that will result in a brighter future for humanity.</p>
<p>We strive to combine a clear-eyed view of what is possible with an idealistic yearning for a better tomorrow.</p>
<p>By documenting in an inclusive and transparent manner a foundational modern worldview, we hope to launch something that might be thought of as the world&rsquo;s first open-source religion.</p>
<p>We will work to advance our cause through authoring, publication, education, scientific advocacy, and promotion of literature and the arts as vital elements of human culture.</p>
