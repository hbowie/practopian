							An Integral Approach

					</h3>

					<p><p>A belief in an integral approach is one of the core Practopian principles. At its most basic, this principle simply means that people can see things from different perspectives, and that often no one way of seeing something is the &ldquo;right&rdquo; or only way.</p>

					<p><p>A belief in cultural evolution is one of the core Practopian principles. But what do we mean by human culture? And by its evolution? Let&rsquo;s dive a little deeper to uncover some of the significant ideas lurking behind this simple statement.</p>

					<p><p>A belief in evolution is one of the core Practopian principles. But to say that we believe in evolution means quite a bit more to us than simply a denial of creationism. We also mean to imply that we believe in natural selection as a process for improving things, including human culture.</p>

					<p><p>Belief in imperfection as a fundamental principle may seem like an odd concept but, in fact, it is an essential part of our thinking. Let&rsquo;s look at some of the reasoning behind this principle.</p>

							More Love
						</a>
					</h3>

					<p><p>For me, love is an elemental human feeling that helps to bind us to one another, and to the world around us. It is a feeling of care and appreciation for, and attachment to, people and things of value that have an independent existence outside of ourselves. And while love may not be &ldquo;<em>all</em> we need,&rdquo; it does seem to be an essential starting point for everything else.</p>

					<p><p>A belief in science is one of the core Practopian principles. We embrace science as one way of understanding the universe in which we live, and we accept toolmaking (aka engineering) as one means of improving the human condition.</p>

					<p><p>Whether we are talking about the <em>King James Bible</em>, <em>The Catcher in the Rye</em>, <em>On the Origin of Species</em>, or <em>Wikipedia</em>, we recognize that writing things down is an important means of preserving human knowledge and wisdom, and that both writing and reading are invaluable human activities.</p>

							Value Creation

					<p><p>Many of the Practopian Core Beliefs will seem rather straightforward to most people: Liberty and Equality, for example, are fundamental human values that should sound familiar no matter what your background. The belief in the importance of Value Creation, on the other hand, may be puzzling to many. What do we mean by this phrase, and why does it deserve such focus? Let me try to explain.</p>
