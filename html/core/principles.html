<p>Our principles identify our most fundamental beliefs about the world and our place in it.</p>
<p>Each principle offers us a useful lens through which to better view and understand ourselves and the world around us.</p>
<ol>
<li>We are <a href="../tags/humanism.html"><strong>humanistic</strong></a>: we are focused on human concerns and human potential.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>We strive to <strong><a href="../tags/integral.html">integrate</a></strong> multiple diverse human perspectives in order to arrive at a more complete understanding of ourselves and the world around us.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li>We embrace <strong><a href="../tags/science.html">science</a></strong> as one way of understanding the universe in which we live, and we accept toolmaking (aka engineering) as one means of improving the human condition.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
<li>We believe in <strong><a href="../tags/evolution.html">evolution</a></strong> as an ongoing force in the world, and in particular are interested in the continuing evolution of <a href="../tags/humanism.html">humanity</a>.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="5">
<li>We are particularly interested in <strong><a href="../tags/cultural-evolution.html">cultural evolution</a></strong>, since what it means to be human is so intertwined with our cultural identity.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="6">
<li>We place great value on the <a href="../tags/written-word.html"><strong>written word</strong></a>, including many works of philosophy and literature, but place no faith in any single text that we deem to be sacred.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="7">
<li>We believe that we humans create meaning for ourselves through <a href="../tags/stories.html"><strong>storytelling</strong></a>, that this fundamental human trait becomes manifest in all forms of artistic expression, and that the resulting works of <a href="../tags/art.html">art</a> are important elements of our culture.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="8">
<li>We harbor no romantic notions about the <strong><a href="../tags/imperfection.html">perfectibility</a></strong> of humans or of human society: we are satisfied with progress, and do not demand perfection.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="9">
<li>We believe that <strong><a href="../tags/individuals.html">ordinary individuals</a></strong> have the power to shape our cultural evolution and influence our human condition in ways both positive and negative; our goal is to help all of us make broader, better informed, more deeply felt, more conscious decisions that will help us advance towards a more positive future.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="10">
<li>We believe that we can produce better outcomes for humanity through the application of <strong><a href="../tags/critical-thinking.html">critical thinking</a></strong> and the use of the <a href="../tags/science.html">scientific method</a>.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="11">
<li>In order to achieve positive outcomes from the <strong><a href="../tags/systemic.html">complex social, economic, and ecological systems</a></strong> in which we live, we believe we must think systemically &ndash; rather than simply focusing on the individual actors within these systems &ndash; and need to identify root causes and take actions at that level.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="12">
<li>We experience a sense of <a href="../tags/wonder.html"><strong>wonder</strong></a> in our approach to the world as we encounter the mysterious, the unexpected, the unfamiliar and the inexplicable.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="13">
<li>Although we cannot define the meaning of the word in any comprehensive way &ndash; or, perhaps, <em>because</em> we cannot fully define it &ndash; we believe in <strong><a href="../tags/love.html">love</a></strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let us call love the apprehension of something outside of oneself, some being or form that is other than our self, and yet that affirms the possibility of a greater unity of which we are each but parts, a unity that leaves us still ourselves, and yet also part of something inestimably greater.</p>
<p>This intense feeling of deep affection may be felt in the presence of another person, or a group of people, or a work of art, or another living creature, or some element of the natural world, or in the embrace of the entire world around us.</p>
<p>We want to help shape a world in which there is more of this stuff: more love.</p>
