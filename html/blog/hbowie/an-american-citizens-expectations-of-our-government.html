<p>These are my expectations of our government. I believe these are reasonable expectations for all US citizens to hold, irrespective of party affiliation, location or political orientation. My announced intention is to hold my government officials accountable for meeting these expectations. </p>
<p>This is not a prioritized list, because I believe all of these expectations are equally important, and all are achievable. </p>
<h5>1. America First</h5>
<p>For the great majority of Americans, I want things to get better or, at worst, stay the same; we cannot take actions that will make things worse for large portions of our country.</p>
<h5>2. Short- and Long-Term Thinking</h5>
<p>This cannot be an either/or; we have to have both:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Short-Term/Tactical Thinking</p>
    <p>We want to improve things now.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Long-Term/Strategic Thinking</p>
    <p>We want to take actions that will have positive effects in the future as well; we cannot afford to indulge ourselves in the short term if it will hurt us in the long term. </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h5>3. Informed Self-Interest</h5>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Informed</p>
    <p>By “informed,” I mean with clear knowledge of all relevant facts, and I mean taking into account long-term effects as well as short-term effects. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Self-Interest</p>
    <p>At every level: national, state, local and individual.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h5>4. The Rule of Law</h5>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p>Equal treatment of all Americans before the Law</p></li>
  <li>
  <p>A level playing field for all Americans</p></li>
</ul>
<h5>5. Defense of our Rights</h5>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p>Rights of individuals</p></li>
  <li>
  <p>Rights of cities and local governments, to best serve their citizens </p></li>
  <li>
  <p>Rights of state governments, to best serve their populations</p></li>
</ul>
<h5>6. Efficient and effective use of our resources</h5>
<p>We can best assure this through a sensible combination of:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p>Fair competition;</p></li>
  <li>
  <p>Determination of value by consumers;</p></li>
  <li>
  <p>Enforcement of minimum acceptable standards, for things like safety and environmental impact;</p></li>
  <li>
  <p>Simplification of rules and regulations.</p></li>
</ul>
<h5>7. Equitable distribution of risks and rewards among:</h5>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p>Capital (investors)</p></li>
  <li>
  <p>Labor (workers)</p></li>
  <li>
  <p>Consumers</p></li>
  <li>
  <p>Community</p></li>
</ul>
<h5>8. Preservation and enhancement of our shared identities, at the local and national levels</h5>
<h5>9. Unfettered access to public information</h5>
<h5>10. Innovation</h5>
<p>When society comes up with new and better ways of doing things, everyone benefits. We can foster innovation by:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Encouraging the creation of new ideas;</li>
  <li>Discussion of these ideas based on data and reasoning;</li>
  <li>Weighing of possible risks and rewards, and likelihood of success;</li>
  <li>Experimentation with selected ideas to determine real-world results;</li>
  <li>Keeping what’s known to work;</li>
  <li>Gradually adoption of new ideas shown to be better.</li>
</ol>
<h5>11. Competence</h5>
<p>Government agencies and functions should be effective and capable in achieving their stated goals.</p>
<h5>12. Civic discourse untainted by partisan rancor</h5>
<p>I think we should be able to discuss ideas on their merits, without resorting to name-calling or character assassination. </p>
<hr/>
<p>Over the coming months and years, my intent is to evaluate each governmental action and proposal based on adherence to the expectations listed above, and to vote accordingly in our next elections. </p>
<p>I suggest you do the same. </p>
