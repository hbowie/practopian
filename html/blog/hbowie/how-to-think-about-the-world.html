<p>It seems clear that we have more people today thinking about the condition of our world than we have ever had before. It is not just that we have more people alive today, but that so many of us have means of accessing information about the world that exists outside of the narrow scope of our immediate senses. </p>
<p>So this raises an important question: not <em>what</em> we should think about the world, but <em>how</em> should we think about it?</p>
<p>Let me offer a few points for your consideration. </p>
<h5>1. Acknowledge our fallibility.</h5>
<p>I tend to think <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashiell_Hammett">Dashiell Hammett</a> got it about right when he wrote, in <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0679722602/pagantuna-20">The Dain Curse</a></em>:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Nobody thinks clearly, no matter what they pretend. Thinking&rsquo;s a dizzy business, a matter of catching as many of those foggy glimpses as you can and fitting them together the best you can. That&rsquo;s why people hang on so tight to their beliefs and opinions; because, compared to the haphazard way in which they&rsquo;re arrived at, even the goofiest opinion seems wonderfully clear, sane and self-evident. And if you let it get away from you, then you&rsquo;ve got to dive back into that foggy muddle to wrangle yourself out another to take its place.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The &ldquo;foggy muddle&rdquo; of information about our world seems to get more difficult to navigate every day, so it is probably wise for all of us to approach this challenge with some measure of humility.</p>
<h5>2. Seek out multiple sources of news and multiple perspectives.</h5>
<p>The following chart, created by <a href="http://www.allgeneralizationsarefalse.com/?p=65">Vanessa Otero</a>, may be one of the most important items to have surfaced in the past couple of months. (Click on the image below to see a larger version that will be easier to read.)</p>

<p>We may quibble about the exact placement of some of these media outlets, but that, I think, is to miss the main point, which is that many different sources of news and analysis exist, and that all of them serve different needs. So if you want to get something like the &ldquo;truth,&rdquo; you should obtain input from multiple sources and should be aware of their biases. If you spend all your time getting your news from one or two sources that sell based on sensationalism, or on their ability to confirm your existing opinions, then that is much like eating ice cream for breakfast, lunch and dinner: you need a more varied diet to be intellectually healthy, and you need some content that you will have to work a little harder to digest.</p>
<h5>3. Spend more time reading than listening or watching.</h5>
<p>If I&rsquo;m reading, then I have much more freedom to jump from one article to another, and from one source to another, and to skim a particular news piece rather than taking it all in from start to finish. In other words, when I&rsquo;m reading, I&rsquo;m in the driver&rsquo;s seat, whereas if I&rsquo;m watching a news show on television, or listening to one on the radio, then I&rsquo;ve put the show&rsquo;s producer in the driver&rsquo;s seat, and I become a more passive, less engaged, news recipient. </p>
<p>My other reason for this preference is that I find written words to be a much more informative, less emotionally charged, medium than television. It&rsquo;s not that I&rsquo;m trying to turn my emotions off, but I find that I&rsquo;m better able to engage my critical thinking skills when parsing text, rather than watching moving images. </p>
<h5>4. Discuss ideas first, then events, then people.</h5>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleanor_Roosevelt">Eleanor Roosevelt</a> made a good point when she observed: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Great minds discuss ideas, average ones discuss events, and small minds discuss people.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The point here is not to worry about how great your mind is, but that we can all use our minds more effectively if we try to focus first on ideas, and last on personalities. We can spend a lot of time venting to others of like mind about how much we hate the other party&rsquo;s candidate, and how despicable they are, but none of that is likely to leave any of us any wiser or better informed than we were before. </p>
<h5>5. Read a good book from time to time.</h5>
<p>No matter how we do it, taking in the world through our daily news feeds is a lot like viewing the earth from a fast-moving nap-of-the-earth flight: things are flying by pretty quickly, and it all feels very exciting, but it&rsquo;s hard to get a sense of the big picture. </p>
<p>Reading a good book that offers some fresh perspectives and looks at a broader timescale is a great way to balance the unavoidable 24-hour news cycle. For example, I recently finished <em><a href="http://amzn.to/2lhdmqv">Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind</a></em>, by Yuval Noah Harari, and I thought he offered a number of tremendous insights about the history of our species, how we got here, and where we might be going. A book like this helps me to fit the daily details into a bigger picture of what&rsquo;s going on in the world. </p>
<h5>6. Seek out hard statistics to counteract haphazard impressions.</h5>
<p>The <a href="https://www.gapminder.org/ignorance/">Gapminder Foundation</a> has conducted repeated surveys asking people from around the world to estimate varying rates of progress that have occurred globally in the last several decades, and have repeatedly demonstrated that most people believe that things in general are much worse than they actually are. One of the primary reasons for this ignorance is the strong bias of news media to spend most of their time on events that are outliers, precisely because it is the unusual event, and in particular the calamitous event, that people find most interesting. This is not to say that everything is wonderful, and that we shouldn&rsquo;t be concerned about bad things that happen in the world, but it is to say that we should be careful to form opinions and make decisions only after seeing the relevant statistical data, rather than relying on the latest anecdotes from the evening news. </p>
<h5>7. Keep asking &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;.</h5>
<p>It is neither very satisfying nor helpful to know what has happened without knowing why it has happened. Yet sometimes knowing the immediate cause of an event is not much better. Why did Donald Trump become President of the United States? Because he garnered the majority of the electoral votes. But why did he get enough of those votes to win? See &ldquo;<a href="http://www.Practopian.org/blog/hbowie/another-way-to-think-about-the-us-elections.html">Another Way to Think about the US Elections</a>&rdquo; for one possible answer. But whether you agree with my analysis or not, we can probably agree that, if we ask enough &ldquo;why&rdquo; questions, we can eventually gain a deeper understanding of the world around us.</p>
