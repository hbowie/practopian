<p>It increasingly feels like we are a society that has lost its ability to have a conversation about anything important.</p>
<p>We brandish labels and slogans as weapons, divorced of any real meaning. &ldquo;Liberal!&rdquo; &ldquo;Republican!&rdquo; &ldquo;Christian!&rdquo; &ldquo;Muslim!&rdquo; &ldquo;America First!&rdquo; &ldquo;Immigration!&rdquo; &ldquo;Free Trade!&rdquo; &ldquo;Globalization!&rdquo; &ldquo;Taxation!&rdquo; &ldquo;Regulation!&rdquo; &ldquo;Family Values!&rdquo; And we seem to be able to come together only in opposition to something &ndash; even if it&rsquo;s something of which we have little common understanding, such as the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/07/upshot/one-third-dont-know-obamacare-and-affordable-care-act-are-the-same.html">Affordable Care Act (aka &ldquo;Obamacare&rdquo;)</a>.</p>
<p>Part of the problem seems to be that we have no common definitions for what we mean by the labels we so frequently use. We have a lot of emotions tied to them, but little shared understanding of what they mean.</p>
<p>Note that it doesn&rsquo;t have to be this way. If I were to gather together a roomful of scientists, and ask them what was meant by the word &ldquo;triangle,&rdquo; they would have no problem at all speedily reaching agreement. Yet if I were to gather together a roomful of our citizens, and ask them what was meant by the word &ldquo;Christian,&rdquo; or what was meant by the term &ldquo;Liberal,&rdquo; I doubt that I would hear two of the same answers, and also doubt that these good folks could reach any kind of agreement on shared definitions, no matter how long I left them in that hypothetical room.</p>
<p>No wonder then that our civic discourse, which makes such frequent use of terms like these, is unable to make much headway.</p>
<p>Some little time ago, after yet another unproductive conversation with family members about the state of our society, I began to wonder: is there some set of shared principles and values that could be concisely stated, and that we could potentially reach agreement on? And, more personally, could I fashion some sort of credo that represented my most fundamental beliefs, in a way that could be shared broadly and inclusively with my fellow citizens? And yet also something that was not so vague as to be completely meaningless?</p>
<p>It took me a while to sift through my feelings and beliefs to arrive at answers to these questions, but I&rsquo;ve recently come up with some words that I feel do a decent job of representing a worldview that I hold, and that I feel that many if not most of us might be able to agree to.</p>
<p>You can find these words in the Core section of the <a href="https://www.Practopian.org/index.html">Practopians</a> website (short for &ldquo;Practical Utopians&rdquo;) and, more specifically, on the two pages listing the Practopian <a href="https://www.Practopian.org/core/principles.html">Principles</a> and <a href="https://www.Practopian.org/core/values.html">Values</a>.</p>
<p>Note that these words are meant to be inclusive, not divisive: whether you consider yourself a Christian, or a Muslim, a Jew, a Buddhist, or an atheist, my hope is that you can subscribe to this set of core beliefs, and that we can use them as a basis for meaningful and constructive dialogue.</p>
<p>These words are also meant to be concise: there are only a baker&rsquo;s dozen worth of principles, expressed in less than a thousand words, and only twelve values, stated in even less space.</p>
<p>Can we agree on these shared principles and values? If not, why not? Is there something fundamental that is missing? Or is there something here you can&rsquo;t stomach?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to hear your feedback. Positive or negative, question or comment, shoot me a note at <a href="mailto:feedback@Practopian.org">feedback@Practopian.org</a>.</p>
<p>It would be wonderful if a majority of us could reach some agreement on just what sort of society we are.</p>
