<p>Just today, after the inauguration of President Trump, as well as the following protest marches all across the country, I began to get a new sense of just how strange the Trump presidency is likely to be. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m old enough to remember the protest marches of the sixties, but those demonstrations involved early adopters who were in the forefront of cultural changes that only later became norms for the majority of Americans. </p>
<p>One of the most revealing stories I can recall about Nixon from those days was a tale of his walking out to the Lincoln Memorial in the early hours one morning, and talking to a few random students who had traveled hundreds of miles to protest the Vietnam war, and <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2011/11/i-am-not-a-kook-richard-nixons-bizarre-visit-to-the-lincoln-memorial/248443/">asking them about their schools&rsquo; football teams</a>. </p>
<p>This happened late in Nixon&rsquo;s failing presidency, and seemed a clear indication at the time, to those who understood the depth and breadth of students&rsquo; concerns, of the President&rsquo;s inability to effectively grapple with the forces that were starting to overwhelm him. </p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s compare this, one of the lowest points of any modern presidency, to where we&rsquo;re at today. </p>
<ol>
  <li>
  <p>We have a brand new presidency, one yet to actually do anything.</p></li>
  <li>
  <p>We now know that Trump trailed his opponent by <a href="http://time.com/4608555/hillary-clinton-popular-vote-final/">almost 3 million in the popular vote</a>. </p></li>
  <li>
  <p>According to all major polls, <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/trump-low-approval-rating-transition-233678">over half of Americans already disapprove of Trump</a>. </p></li>
  <li>
  <p>In his <a href="http://www.npr.org/2017/01/20/510629447/watch-live-president-trumps-inauguration-ceremony">inauguration speech</a>, our new President used rhetoric clearly intended to appeal to his established base, without any words that would reach across to the majority of Americans who did not vote for him, and who currently disapprove of him. </p></li>
  <li>
  <p>On the second day of the new presidency we witnessed <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2017/01/22/us/22reuters-usa-trump-women.html">massive protests</a> all across the country, including crowds in Washington DC <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/22/us/politics/president-trump-inauguration-crowd-white-house.html">three times the size of those that turned out to watch the inauguration</a>. </p></li>
  <li>
  <p>These demonstrators did not turn out to protest any specific policy, but simply to voice their objections to the man himself.</p></li>
  <li>
  <p>Our new president seems constitutionally incapable of acknowledging any sign of weakness, even when faced with indisputable facts. </p></li>
  <li>
  <p>We have a president who has surrounded himself with counselors, including a press secretary, who seem to have no clue of how to respond to facts and people that don&rsquo;t support their people and positions, other than to scream at reporters and appeal to &ldquo;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/22/us/politics/president-trump-inauguration-crowd-white-house.html">alternative facts</a>.&rdquo;</p></li>
</ol>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard for me to fully express how strange all of this feels. We have a president whose <a href="http://www.Practopian.org/blog/hbowie/another-way-to-think-about-the-us-elections.html">leadership style</a> admittedly won him strong appeal from a large minority of our nation. But that same style seems totally unsuited to actually leading our entire country, and Trump seems to have no alternative style available to him, and seems incapable of adapting this style to his new situation: not as an outsider challenging the establishment, but as the leader of our country. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s as if we&rsquo;ve seen <a href="http://www.potw.org/archive/potw351.html">Yeats&rsquo; rough beast</a> finally stumble into Bethlehem, rise up on his haunches to present himself as our new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Emperor's_New_Clothes">Emperor</a>, and demand that we adore his fine raiment, even though most citizens of our country can tell that he&rsquo;s buck naked, and are willing to tell him so to his face. </p>
<p>Strange days indeed. And hard to see how they will become anything but stranger. </p>
