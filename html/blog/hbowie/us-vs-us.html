<p>It seems that we humans have an innate tendency to see those who are different from us as a threat, and to then attack those different ones. </p>
<p>Oh, we can draw the dividing line in many different ways: my team vs. your team, blacks vs. whites, men vs. women, straights vs. gays, liberals vs. conservatives, Democrats vs. Republicans, citizens vs. immigrants, urban vs. rural, Christians vs. Muslims, atheists vs. the religious, business vs. individuals, white-collar vs. blue-collar, college-educated vs. those without degrees, management vs. labor, government vs. business, agile vs. waterfall (for the software developers out there!) and on and on and on. </p>
<p>Us versus Them. </p>
<p>It seems to be a universal animus that helps to motivate our actions and inflame our communications. </p>
<p>But is it helpful? </p>
<p>In the month or so since the US elections, I&rsquo;ve become sensitized to several issues related to this divisive tendency:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
  <p>The many ways in which our political leaders, non-profits and news media are repeatedly punching our &ldquo;us vs. them&rdquo; buttons in order to capture our attention and our dollars;</p></li>
  <li>
  <p>The large amount of time we spend listening to others talking about &ldquo;them,&rdquo; compared to the small amount of time we spend actually interacting with &ldquo;them&rdquo; directly; </p></li>
  <li>
  <p>The need so many of us feel to define ourselves, not by what we <em>stand for</em>, but by whom we <em>stand against</em>. </p></li>
</ol>
<p>When I step back from all of the communications streams washing over me every day, and try to distance myself a bit from these issues, none of this feels all that healthy or helpful. In fact, it feels a bit sickening. Increasingly, it feels like we&rsquo;re being systematically turned against ourselves.</p>
<p>Us versus Us. </p>
